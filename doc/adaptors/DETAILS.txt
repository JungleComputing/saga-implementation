This document gives more information about the adaptors,
what they do and do not implement.

General remark:
None of the adaptors currently implement the SAGA permissions interface,
i.e. the method implementations throw the NotImplemented exception.
Reason: there is no support for permissions in the underlying software.

Package SAGA stream
-------------------

- JavaGAT
  The JavaGAT adaptor for the stream package is built on JavaGAT EndPoint
  and JavaGAT Pipe. The adaptor implementation also depends on the JavaGAT
  advertService. Unfortunately, at the moment only a local advertService
  is available for JavaGAT, which means that this streams adaptor only
  works locally.
  * adaptor for StreamService:
    except for the permissions, this adaptor is complete.
  * adaptor for Stream:
    STREAM_WRITE metric is not supported. Reason: there is no support for it
    in javaGAT.
    waitFor(Activity.WRITE) is not supported. Reason: there is no support
    for it in javaGAT.
    Stream attributes are not supported yet. BLOCKING (or actually,
    non-blocking) may be supported in the future for reads.

- TCP
  The TCP adaptor for the stream package is built on java.net.socket.
  * adaptor for StreamService:
    accepts URLs with scheme "tcp" and scheme "any";
    complete except for permissions.
  * adaptor for Stream:
    STREAM_WRITE metric is not supported. Reason: there is no support for it
    in java.net.sockets.
    waitFor(Activity.WRITE) is not supported. Reason: there is no support
    for it in java.net.sockets.
    Stream attributes are not supported yet. BLOCKING (or actually,
    non-blocking) will be supported in the future.

Package SAGA job
----------------

- JavaGAT
  The JavaGAT adaptor for the job package is built on JavaGAT Resources,
  for which various adaptors are available: ssh, globus, gridsam, glite, to name
  a few.
  * adaptor for JobService.
    getSelf() is not implemented.
    Reason: don't know how to implement, at the moment.
  * JobDescriptionAttributes that are not implemented:
    SPMDVARIATION,
    THREADSPERPROCESS, JOBCONTACT, JOBSTARTTIME.
    Also, post-stage append and pre-stage append is not supported.
    Reason: there is no corresponding mechanism in JavaGAT job descriptions.
  * JobAttributes that are not implemented:
    TERMSIG.
    Reason: not supported in JavaGAT.
  * Job metrics that are not implemented:
    JOB_SIGNAL, JOB_CPUTIME, JOB_MEMORYUSE, JOB_VMEMORYUSE, JOB_PERFORMANCE.
    Reason: not supported in JavaGAT.
  * Methods that are not implemented:
    signal(), checkpoint(), migrate(). There is no support for it in JavaGAT.
  * it should be noted that although the mapping from a SAGA job description
    to a JavaGAT jobdescription is mostly possible, as is the mapping from
    SAGA job methods to JavaGAT job methods, this does not mean that
    JavaGAT adaptors actually implement everything.
    
- GridSAM
  * adaptor for JobService.
    getSelf() is not implemented.
    Reason: don't know how to implement, at the moment.
  * JobDescriptionAttributes that are not implemented:
    WORKINGDIRECTORY, INTERACTIVE, JOBCONTACT, JOBSTARTTIME.
    Also, post-stage append and pre-stage append is not supported.
    Reason: there is no corresponding mechanism in Gridsam job descriptions.
    There is WORKINGDIRECTORY in JSDL, but this is not supported by Gridsam.
    In addition, the SPMD extensions are not implemented yet in this adaptor.
  * JobAttributes that are not implemented:
    TERMSIG.
    Reason: not supported in gridsam.
  * Job metrics that are not implemented:
    JOB_SIGNAL, JOB_CPUTIME, JOB_MEMORYUSE, JOB_VMEMORYUSE, JOB_PERFORMANCE.
    Reason: not supported in gridsam.
  * Methods that are not implemented:
    signal(), suspend(), resume(), checkpoint(), migrate().

Package SAGA namespace
----------------------

- JavaGAT
  the SAGA namespace package is built on JavaGAT File, for which various
  adaptors are available: ssh, globus, sftp, to name a few.
  * adaptor for NSEntry.
    There is no concept of links in JavaGAT, so all methods dealing with links
    are not supported.
  * adaptor fo NSDirectory
    There is no concept of links in JavaGAT, so all methods dealing with links
    are not supported.
    
- Local
  Uses Java's local file API to access the local filesystem. All namespace 
  operations use the class java.io.File, except for the copy() method which 
  uses the class java.nio.FileChannel. 
  * adaptor for NSEntry
    There is no concept of links (yet) in Java, so all methods dealing with 
    links are not supported.
  * adaptor for NSDirectory
    There is no concept of links (yet) in Java, so all methods dealing with 
    links are not supported.
    
- Archive
  Uses the TrueZip library to access the local filesystem. Archive files (e.g.
  ZIP files, JAR files etc.) are interpreted as directories.
  * adaptor for NSEntry
    There is no concept of links (yet) in Java, so all methods dealing with 
    links are not supported.
  * adaptor for NSDirectory
    There is no concept of links (yet) in Java, so all methods dealing with 
    links are not supported.

Package SAGA file
-----------------

- JavaGAT
  * adaptor for File
    unimplemented: modesE(), readE(), writeE(), sizeE(), for which there
    is no support. In addition, readP and writeP only have the implementation
    inherited from the base implementation, which translates the patterns into
    seeks and contiguous reads/writes, which probably is very slow.
    This adaptor is built on the JavaGAT RandomAccessFile, if available
    (which is only local for the current JavaGAT version). If not available,
    FileInputStream or FileOutputStream is used.
  * adaptor for Directory
    implemented, except for permissions.
  * adaptors for FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
    these adaptors are built on the corresponding JavaGAT versions, for which
    several adaptors are available.
    
- Local
  * adaptor for File
    Uses java.nio.FileChannel for read(), write(), seek() and getSize().
    unimplemented: modesE(), readE(), writeE(), sizeE(), for which there
    is no support. In addition, readP and writeP only have the implementation
    inherited from the base implementation, which translates the patterns into
    seeks and contiguous reads/writes, which probably is very slow.
  * adaptor for Directory
    implements all operations, except for permissions.
  * adaptors for FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
    these adaptors are built on their counterparts in the package java.io.
    
- Archive
  * adaptor for File
    only implements getSize(), since TrueZip does not support random read and 
    write access to files inside an archive.
  * adaptor for Directory
    implements all operations, except for permissions.
  * adaptors for FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
    these adaptors are built on their counterparts in the TrueZip library.

Package SAGA logicalfile
------------------------

- Generic
  * adaptor for LogicalFile
    This adaptor uses the SAGA file and namespace packages to store the
    contents of the logicalfile. A logicalfile is just a file containing
    a list of URLs.
  * adaptor for LogicalDirectory
    Built on top of the SAGA namespace package.

Package SAGA RPC
----------------

- XMLRPC
  * adaptor for RPC
    This adaptor implements the RPC package on XMLRPC. It is built on top
    of the Apache XMLRPC client library. Limitation: at most one OUT
    parameter is supported.
