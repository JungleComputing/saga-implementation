1.0rc3 (???)
   This release fixes some problems in release 1.0rc2. Notably:
   - a wrong version was included for some demo applications;
   - there was a problem with the JavaGAT adaptor for GridSAM: JavaGAT
     sandboxes did not work properly;
   - there were some other problems with the JavaGAT GridSAM adaptor as well.

1.0rc2 (9 June 2008)
   This release reflects a change in the Java Language Bindings, which adds
   an URLFactory, so that SAGA implementations can provide their own URL
   class.

1.0rc1 (21 May 2008)
   This release implements the corresponding version of the Java SAGA
   language bindings. Changes with respect to the 0.9 version are,
   a.o.:
   - this version includes an XMLRPC implementation of the RPC package.
   - this version includes a generic logicalfile package implementation,
     generic in that it is completely built on top of the SAGA file
     and namespace packages. The JavaGAT adaptor for the logicalfile
     package was removed because it did not function.
   - the Gridsam adaptor is rewritten to use the gridsam-supplied libraries
     for generating JSDL.

0.9 (3 April 2008)
   This is the first public release of this Java SAGA implementation.
   It includes adaptors for the job, namespace, file, logicalfile,
   and stream packages. Also included are a Gridsam job adaptor and
   a socket stream adaptor.
