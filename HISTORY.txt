Release 1.1 (?? October 2010)
  This release incorporates the changes required  by the changes in the Saga
  specification (and the Java language bindings):
  - Buffer factory method no longer throws NotImplementedException.
  - Buffer methods no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - Context factory method no longer throws NotImplementedException.
  - Context setDefault() method no longer exists. Instead, an implementation
    can add default values for attributes when a context is added to a session.
  - IOVec factory method no longer throws NotImplementedException.
  - a JobDescription has two new attributes: WALLTIMELIMIT and JOBPROJECT.
  - the JobService create method now may throw a BadParameterException.
  - a Job now has a new attribute: SERVICEURL.
  - the READ and WRITE flags are moved to the namespace package.
  - NSDirectory now has a method getMTime(URL) that returns the last modification
    time of the specified entry, and also a task version of same.
  - NSEntry now has a method getMTime() that returns the last modification time
    of the entry at hand, and also a task version of same.
  - the NSEntry.link(URL) method can now throw DoesNotExistException.
  - NSEntry.close() no longer throws IncorrectStateException.
  - various namespace methods now have READ as default flag instead of NONE.
  - Session constructor methods can no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - Session.addContext() can no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - Session.removeContext() can no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - Session.listContexts() can no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - Session.close() can no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - TASKCONTAINER_STATE attribute is now of type String and indicates a
    Saga Object ID instead of a handle or cookie.
  - TaskContainer.add(Task t) now does not return a cookie anymore.
  - TaskContainer.remove() now takes a task instead of a cookie as parameter.
  - TaskContainer now has a version of "waitFor" with a timeout.
  - TaskContainer.getTask() now takes a string (object id) instead of an int
    (cookie).
  - TaskContainer.listTasks() is removed, as we already have getTasks().
  - Task.getResult() now can throw any Saga exception. It returns the result of
    the method executed, including its exceptions.
  - URL factory methods can no longer throw NotImplementedException.
  - URL now has a method getEscaped() which returns the URL as a string, with
    escapes added where needed to parse the result as an URL.
  - URL now has default parameters for various set... methods.
  - StreamService has been renamed StreamServer. A StreamServer object now
    can also represent a remote server. It also has a connect() method now.
  - Stream.connect() now also has a variant with a timeout.
  - Stream.close() can no longer throw IncorrectState.

  This release also fixes a couple of problems in Release 1.0.1:
  - recursively deleting a directory did not work.
  - attributes of type Time used milliseconds instead of seconds.
  - updated JavaGAT with fixed FTP file adaptor.
  - sort adaptor directory list for deterministic behaviour.

Release 1.0.1 (24 April 2009)
  This release fixes various problems in release 1.0:
  - This release now contains JavaGAT release 2.0.5, which fixes many problems
    of its earlier releases.
  - Saga now uses slf4j as logging system. This means that you can use
    your favorite logging system, as long as there is an slf4j implementation
    for it. To accomplish that, you need to put the appropriate slf4j jar-file
    in front of your classpath. If, like before, you want to use log4j, you
    don't have to do anything, since this is the default.
  - Fixed classloader issue: use either the classloader of the class that
    prompted the loading of SAGA or the context classloader, for the
    parent of the URL classloaders for the adaptors.
  - The Saga engine now supports a "shared" jar-file directory, which allows
    adaptors to share some of their dependencies, so that these are loaded
    with the same classloader. This is useful for for instance security
    objects that need to be shared by several adaptors.
  - The existsAttribute method was added to Attributes.
  - URL and Parameter now implements SagaObject.
  - The Saga engine no longer depends on an environment variable SAGA_LOCATION.
    It now uses the saga.location system property. The scripts now use
    JAVA_SAGA_LOCATION.
  - Made removeContext() to work.
  - Modified the exception chaining mechanism: now, the most informative
    exception is thrown, but exceptions from all adaptors can be obtained
    by iterating over them.
  - Tasking versions of factory methods did not work, because the methods
    were not public.
  - Fixed a race in job.cancel().
  - Added a mechanism that allows for adaptor-specific attributes in a context.
  - Fixed the clone mechanism in the Adaptor invocation handler: it did not
    work at all.
  - WorkingDirectory attribute of Job was missing.
  - Some stuff was added for the Service Discovery implementation.
  - For the gridsam adaptor: protect the command and arguments against
    expansion of shell meta characters.
  - Fixed NSDirectory constructor: it should fail if the argument exists and
    is not a directory.
  - improved the list() performance of the JavaGAT adaptor.

Release 1.0 (16 September 2008)
   This release contains a new version of the JavaGAT, which now includes
   a glite adaptor for the Job (in JavaGAT terms: ResourceBroker) package.
   This release incorporates the changes that were required to make it run
   with the new JavaGAT (which has a few API changes). Also, the engine now
   orders exceptions as obtained from adaptors differently. If one adaptor
   throws NotImplemented, and another throws DoesNotExist, the user presumably
   wants to see DoesNotExist, and not NotImplemented (as would be the case if
   the ordering of the SAGA specs whould be obeyed).
   
Release 1.0rc3 (11 July 2008)
   This release fixes some problems in release 1.0rc2. Notably:
   - a wrong version was included for some demo applications;
   - there was a problem with the JavaGAT adaptor for GridSAM: JavaGAT
     sandboxes did not work properly;
   - SAGA Gridsam adaptor made to work with Java 6.

Release 1.0rc2 (9 June 2008)
   This release reflects a change in the Java Language Bindings, which adds
   an URLFactory, so that SAGA implementations can provide their own URL
   class.

Release 1.0rc1 (21 May 2008)
   This release implements the corresponding version of the Java SAGA
   language bindings. Changes with respect to the 0.9 version are,
   a.o.:
   - this version includes an XMLRPC implementation of the RPC package.
   - this version includes a generic logicalfile package implementation,
     generic in that it is completely built on top of the SAGA file
     and namespace packages. The JavaGAT adaptor for the logicalfile
     package was removed because it did not function.
   - the Gridsam adaptor is rewritten to use the gridsam-supplied libraries
     for generating JSDL.

0.9 (3 April 2008)
   This is the first public release of this Java SAGA implementation.
   It includes adaptors for the job, namespace, file, logicalfile,
   and stream packages. Also included are a Gridsam job adaptor and
   a socket stream adaptor.
